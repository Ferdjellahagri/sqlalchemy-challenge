Unpaired (Independent t-test)
* Independent t-tests compare the means of 2 independent populations (June temperatures in Hawaii and December temperatures in Hawaii).
* We want to use an independent t-test because we want to compare the means of two independent populations. A paired t-test (one sample t-test) looks at comparing the sample to the population, which we don't want in this case.
* Assumptions - Data are normally distributed, data are independent, data are homogenous (The standard deviations are roughly equal).
